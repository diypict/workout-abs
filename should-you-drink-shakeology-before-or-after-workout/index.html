When you refuel your body with the right stuff, like shakeology, you also prepare your body for the next workout. If you continue to experience serious digestive discomfort with smaller amounts, check in with your doctor.</p>
<h3 id="but-the-timing-of-when-you-should-consume-the-most-protein-is-a-highly-contested-topic">But The Timing Of When You Should Consume The Most Protein Is A Highly Contested Topic.</h3><p>In this small study, one group of men received a protein shake before their workout and the other received a protein shake immediately after their workout, and each participant performed a full body strength. Moreover, drinking a smoothie before a workout can hydrate you. If you plan to do your exercise in the morning, then you can “drink shakeology before a workout” and use it as your breakfast meal. Most people aren’t sure whether to take bcaa before or after workout.</p>

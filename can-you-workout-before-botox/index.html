This is actually pretty easy, just plan your botox session after you’d had your workout for the day and ideally the day before a rest day. How long should i not exercise after botox?</p>
<h3 id="we-recommend-patients-not-to-change-the-position-of-the-head-or-to-bend-over-after-botox-injections">We Recommend Patients Not To Change The Position Of The Head Or To Bend Over After Botox Injections.</h3><p>Give your face a workout. ‘while historically we always said to please avoid exercise for a week after getting botox, it’s actually less of a concern than it is for those having dermal fillers, where exercise can cause prolonged swelling,’ says dr sophie shotter from. However, you are able to exercise before botox at least a few hours before you get your treatment. You are not allowed to do exercise for approximately 24 to 48 hours.</p>

Overall, exercising right after getting botox is not an advisable idea. Ultimately, you don’t want to risk affecting your botox results by exercising too soon after your treatment.

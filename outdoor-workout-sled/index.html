Training sleds are versatile resistance training devices used for pushing, pulling, and dragging exercises to increase speed and strength. 4.7 out of 5 stars. You can use the power sled on grass, astroturf, field turf, track, gravel and even cement if you do not care about the power sled getting scratched.</p>
<h3 id="this-will-keep-the-pipe-from-getting-damaged">This Will Keep The Pipe From Getting Damaged.</h3><p>Built for year round outdoor use! Use the first round, to find a comfortable tempo and try to maintain this for the entire 4 rounds. Unlike traditional sleds, this resistance will increase and decrease based on your explosive power and provides a great variable resistance training tool for your early morning workout. The workout alternates 400m runs with sled work.</p>

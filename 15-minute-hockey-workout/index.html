Please do not use this training program on bantam (u14) age level or lower. Try out this 15 minute balance board workout to strengthen both your leg stabilizers and primary movers. It is a twelve week program divided into 4 sections of 3 weeks with 3 workout days per week.</p>
<h3 id="hockey-specific-leg-strength-day">Hockey Specific Leg Strength Day.</h3><p>To add some spice to your bland routine, try some more explosive training methods that will increase your power while giving you a surprisingly good cardio workout. Start with your left leg forward, right leg back, and a heavier dumbbell in your right hand at your side. Stretch 5 to 10 minutes at the end of the workout. It is appropriate for midget, high school, junior, college, and pro level players.</p>

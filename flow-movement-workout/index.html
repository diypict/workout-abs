<h3 id="underswitch-taps-to-side-kick">Underswitch Taps To Side Kick.</h3><p>Complete 3 to 4 rounds of each movement; Animal flow is ground based movement, made fun, challenging and effective. If you are new to flow movement and would like to study at home, begin with the fluid movement starter pack. The floor is your equipment—you roll around on it a lot.</p>
<h3 id="you-can-use-people-as-inspiration-and-whatnot-but-the-thing-is-is-flow-is-going-to-come-down-to-your-mastery-of-a-particular-movement-and-being-able-to-use-it-for-yourself">You Can Use People As Inspiration And Whatnot But The Thing Is Is Flow Is Going To Come Down To Your Mastery Of A Particular Movement And Being Able To Use It For Yourself.</h3><p>In a flow movement workout, your body weight provides your resistance. This 12 video beginner course will help change your relationship to movement through floor and mobility work. It challenges the body through multiple planes of movement and is a great compliment to barbell work and explosive power athletes (runners, jumpers, oly lifters, martial arts, etc). It’s a fairly intermediate flow, but you can practice it any time you want to feel grounded and build up your body.</p>

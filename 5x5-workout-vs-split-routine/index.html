<h3 id="first-set-135x5-second-set-185x5-followed-by-three-sets-of-225x5">First Set 135X5, Second Set 185X5, Followed By Three Sets Of 225X5.</h3><p>Train three days per week for three months. There is very little variation within the program in terms of exercise selection; Entire workout time can be less a week than with split routines. Also, this really makes a big difference in the amount of muscle tone you’ll get from this workout.</p>
<h3 id="i-would-like-to-start-a-5x5-program">I Would Like To Start A 5X5 Program.</h3><p>There are many similarities between these two workouts, like the fact that they both have assisting exercises for smaller muscle groups. Also this workout should not be exceeded for more than 4 weeks as it could lead to injury. 5x5 uses big compound lifts to build muscle mass and advance strength. Madcow’s 5×5 is a workout program that increases total body strength and begins with 4 sets of 5 reps with weight that gradually increases until the final heavy, 5th set.</p>
<h3 id="rest-2-minutes-between-sets">Rest 2 Minutes Between Sets.</h3><p>This would be a 3 workout per week routine. Another similarity between them is that they are both made up of basic, compound movements and focus on strength development. Moreover, doing three different compounds in each workout will also yield gains. Rest, as needed, between all sets, and at least 90 seconds between sets of the 5×5 exercises.</p>

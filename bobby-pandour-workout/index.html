My tribute to bobby pandour. Bobby pandour’s training is highly controversial. In this video i detail bobby pandour’s training methods and workout.</p>
<h3 id="old-article-by-muscle-control-artist-otto-arco-published-1942">Old Article By Muscle Control Artist ‘Otto Arco’ Published 1942!</h3><p>My tribute to bobby pandour. It’s believed that he trained with 10lbs dumbbells and avoided heavy lifting on purpose. Boredom may be avoided by the scenic nature of the walking path, but not by exercise variation for the most part! Either with 50 reps or massive tension.</p>

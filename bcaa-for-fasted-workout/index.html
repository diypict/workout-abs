<h3 id="but-it-becomes-more-important-when-you-are-fasting">But It Becomes More Important When You Are Fasting.</h3><p>If you like intermittent fasting, bcaas are a great addition. However, bcaas are great for preserving muscle during a fast, or for speeding up muscle growth from fasted workouts.

It prevents muscle breakdown and reduces muscle soreness. Bcaas are unique compared to other amino acids because they are metabolized directly in the muscle, instead of in the liver. He has them consume 10 grams of aminos at the start of their first workout with 10 more grams every two.</p>

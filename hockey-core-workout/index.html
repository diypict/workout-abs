When i talk about being fit for hockey, unlike a lot of hockey players i don’t just mean the ability to run for 70 minutes.hockey fitness is also about being strong, fast, agile, powerful, core strength, having mobility &amp; flexibility, recovering quickly in order to dominate physically on the field. To establish a stable core, all hockey players should start with a basic core training circuit involving front planks, side planks, and glute bridges.</p>

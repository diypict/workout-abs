USA Basketball The Definitive 6Week Guard Workout From usab.com
The following workouts are for guards and post players. This is a workout that can be done with or without coaches supervision but you need to push yourself if there is no coach available. What i mean by that is if you are a guard that just flat out can’t shoot the basketball then you don’t need to be working on your step back jump shots off the dribble. Everyone wants to train like the pro’s.

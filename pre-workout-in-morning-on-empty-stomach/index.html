Exercising on an empty stomach could make the body use protein as fuel, and protein is needed to build and repair muscles. This leaves your body with less protein, which is needed. Using fat as energy does not particularly mean it is going to decrease overall body fat percentage or burn more calories.</p>
<h3 id="even-if-you-exercise-in-the-morning-and-dont-eat-until-the-evening-the-wave-of-gh-youll-be-riding-all-day-may-help-prevent-muscle-loss">Even If You Exercise In The Morning And Don’t Eat Until The Evening, The Wave Of Gh You’ll Be Riding All Day May Help Prevent Muscle Loss.</h3><p>I am taking white flood right now and i haven�t noticed that recommendatin (not to say its not there). Working out on an empty stomach burns more fat. Assuming your liver has a full tank, you burn 10 grams of glucose while sleeping, so you burn your entire liver reserve. I’ve trained on an empty stomach in the morning without a problem, but not in the afternoon and certainly not in the evening.</p>

<h3 id="attach-the-ankle-strap-to-one-of-your-legs-pick-your-favorite-walk-to-the-starting-position-facing-the-opposite-way-from-the-cable-machine">Attach The Ankle Strap To One Of Your Legs (Pick Your Favorite) Walk To The Starting Position, Facing The Opposite Way From The Cable Machine.</h3><p>With the cable pulley on the low setting, attach the strap to one leg. Place a short resistance loop around your thighs, just above your knees. Resistance band exercises for legs: 4.8 out of 5 stars.</p>

Squats, deadlifts, lunges, bulgarian split squats, donkey kicks, glute kickbacks, and glute bridges are all great glute exercises. Glutes (activators) *it doesn’t matter that the exercises i do for chest, back, and arms are activators or stretchers as they are a different muscle group so are already well rested. When you’re sitting a lot in your daily life, it’s best to do these exercises every day. I�ve been obsessed with the glutes for over 2 decades.

I don’t tend to run further than six miles at a time, because for me that’s the perfect distance where if i’m on expedition and i need to get somewhere, six miles is a good distance to be prepared to cover. Exercise like i do with minimal kit and short time windows, no need for a gym or expensive equipment.</p>

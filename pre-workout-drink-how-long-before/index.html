<h3 id="during-your-workout-it-is-recommended-that-you-drink-plenty-of-water">During Your Workout, It Is Recommended That You Drink Plenty Of Water.</h3><p>Working out destroys muscle tissue (catabolism), but during recovery, your body rebuilds the damaged tissue. With mild to moderate workouts, you can also switch to natural energy drinks. Another good reason to take a protein shake before a workout could be that you train early in the morning, or rush off during your lunch break and simply don’t have time to eat. If you are working out early in the morning, a protein shake or very light meal can be eaten as little as 15 to 30 minutes before your workout.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-water-should-i-drink-pre-workout">How Much Water Should I Drink Pre Workout?</h3><p>The anabolic (or metabolic) window is the famous 30 to 60 minute timespan after a workout during which nutrition can help your body shift from a catabolic to an anabolic state.</p>

<h3 id="when-consumed-they-go-straight-to-the-liver-and-provide-fast-acting-energy-in-much-the-same-way-as-glucose">When Consumed, They Go Straight To The Liver And Provide Fast Acting Energy In Much The Same Way As Glucose.</h3><p>If you like to sweat and you appreciate pushing your body to the brink of complete and utter exhaustion, than shawn t’s “insanity workout” is definitely something that you will want to try. If you like to add ketchup or other condiments to your meal but want to do so in a ketonic way, you can add mct oil to the overall condiment to reap the benefits. It�s also some small studies shown mct oils post workout can help with recovery , maybe i�m back tracking not sure. This fall and winter i did a slow bulk and gained 30 lbs.</p>
<h3 id="and-by-reducing-fat-storage-and-waist-circumference">And By Reducing Fat Storage And Waist Circumference.</h3><p>To help get in my calories, i mixed 1 tbsp of mct oil in with my daily protein shake. During exercise, mcts can reduce lactate buildup and improve exercise performance. Mct oil supports weight loss by increasing fullness, fat burning, ketone production, and improving your gut flora. Mct oil occurs naturally in coconut oil and other foods.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-accidentally-take-too-much-scale-back-a-bit-for-a-couple-days">If You Accidentally Take Too Much, Scale Back A Bit For A Couple Days.</h3><p>Because when you�re on a carb diet you take carbs pre and post for energy and recovery to help spare protein so the protein can be used for building and recovery and not being broken down by the liver , so the same should go for fat mct oils pre and post not just pre. Mct simply stands for medium chain triglycerides, as opposed to long chain triglycerides (lct), which are found in most foods. I have used mct oil myself many times over the years. You’ll know if it’s too much.</p>

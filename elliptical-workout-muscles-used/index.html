Not only will the elliptical help you to strengthen your shoulders and build up the muscles in your legs, but it can also be used to target core muscles and the unique areas of fat and muscle in the middle of your body. Triceps and pectorals are pushing, or press, muscles;</p>
<h3 id="what-muscles-does-the-elliptical-work-on-reverse">What Muscles Does The Elliptical Work On Reverse?</h3><p>Unlike the stationary bicycle, which puts most of the work in the quadriceps, elliptical machines provide an equally effective workout for the hamstrings, glutes and, in some cases, the upper body. What muscles do elliptical workouts focus on? Elliptical machines work on both pushing and pulling muscles. The elliptical engages the core muscles as the user maintains the proper upright posture when using the exercise machine.</p>

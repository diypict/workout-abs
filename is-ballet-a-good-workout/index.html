Ballet barre workout moves to try at home Liz Earle From lizearlewellbeing.com
They won’t, but i think it is a good jumping off point for discussing how classical ballet exercises actually work and what exercises aren’t appropriate for dancers. Ballet is a great way to get into shape. Though ballet barre fitness is inspired from ballet, it is very different. It’s only 15 min cardio workout but super productive, it will get you moving, sweating and feel good for a total body ballet fitness session.

Ryan Crouser Workout Specificity and Transfer of From joanieandaaronsweddin.blogspot.com
Ryan crouser is on an unprecedented shot putting roll. The olympic champion has won his last four competitions with throws of 22.56m, 22.72m, 22.70m and 22.43m, a stretch than can be considered as nothing less than a master class. A lot of younger athletes spend all of their time training bench and squat, but neglect the rotational aspect of the throw in the weight room. According to him, this could actually be a very good exercise to get someone started off with shot put and also a good exercise for someone already into the sport.

In the podcast episode linked above (and in the book) alisa explains how most human studies on exercise and diet are conducted on men. Getting fit, and strategically syncing up your cycle with your workouts is the only way to ensure real results and happy, healthy hormones.</p>
<h3 id="it-refers-to-tracking-your-period-cycle-in-such-a-way-that-you-can-plan-your-workouts-social-life-relationship-activities-and-other-events-according-to">It Refers To Tracking Your Period Cycle In Such A Way That You Can Plan Your Workouts, Social Life, Relationship Activities, And Other Events According To.</h3><p>When implemented properly, cycle syncing exercise to your menstrual cycle can make it easier to stick with a training plan, decrease recovery time, and as a result—improve how you look, feel, and perform. It’s taking advantage of peaks of energy and hot metabolism, while embracing time for recovery and regeneration. Cycle syncing is about aligning almost every aspect of your life to your body�s natural biological infradian rhythms. While the scientific community generally believes that there are two predominant phases of the menstrual cycle, a few others believe that there are four phases of the cycle.</p>
<h3 id="cycle-syncing-is-a-term-coined-and-trademarked-by-alisa-vitti-functional-nutritionist-hhc-aadp">“Cycle Syncing” Is A Term Coined And Trademarked By Alisa Vitti, Functional Nutritionist, Hhc, Aadp.</h3><p>Cycle syncing is the practice of planning your life around all the phases of your menstrual cycle. Cycle syncing is a practice that helps you tune in with your hormonal fluctuation throughout the month. Navigating these changes and planning your workouts, nutrition, and other activities according to your cycle can help you feel your best every day of the month. A better, more healthful way to live is through cycle syncing.</p>

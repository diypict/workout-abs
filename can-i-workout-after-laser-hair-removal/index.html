You can have a shower after laser hair removal treatment but it best to wait until the day.</p>
<h3 id="get-ipl-hair-removal-device">Get Ipl Hair Removal Device:</h3><p>During treatment, heat is applied to the skin which results in redness (erythema) and swelling of the follicles (follicular oedema). Avoid very hot water and use a gentle wash cloth not any exfoliant or scrub for a few days. Didnt you know not to work up sweat after wax/laser hair removal? Upon application the laser should feel like someone is flicking a rubber band on your skin, and if its more painful than that then something could be wrong.</p>

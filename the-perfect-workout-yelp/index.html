GROUP FITNESS TRAINING Svetness Fitness &amp; Nutrition From svetnessfitness.com
For just half an hour twice a week i�m already feeling a difference. The trainers modified the workouts for me as i was new and made sure my posture was right (which in many other places i have not seen)! 5 stars out of 5. I started going twice a week, but after the 2 months i just needed to go ones a week.

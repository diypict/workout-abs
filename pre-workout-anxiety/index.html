It’s no secret that caffeine can heighten anxiety. They were not anxiety attacks or anything crazy. If you’re prone to anxiety, you choose pre workouts containing sensible dosages of caffeine (under 200mg per serving). It take me an hour or two to feel calm again.

<p>I’ve been taking pre workout for 4 years now almost every single day. Stop using preworkouts at once before something serious happens. And while these are not fun and can be uncomfortable for a few hours, they’re not deadly. When i first got on pre workout i would physically shake because of the burst of energy, your mind might be tricking you into thinking you�re having an anxiety attack when in reality you�re just shaking from all the energy, thus then giving you an anxiety attack because your mind is set on the fact that you are having one.</p>

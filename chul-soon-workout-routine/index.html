<h3 id="height-tall-feet-amp-inches">Height (Tall) Feet &amp; Inches:</h3><p>My new huge training program available at chulsoon.com. Korean bodybuilder and fitness model hwang chul soon (황철순) was born on september 1, 1983, in seoul, south korea. This workout from chul soon is one to give you a great classic physique. Musclemania® pro chul soon trains chest with mm korea sports model champs taeho &amp; kukhwan.</p>
<h3 id="it-gives-you-much-better-results">It Gives You Much Better Results.</h3><p>Others may be less traditional judging from this photo. When it comes to his training, chul focuses on compound movements to work many muscle groups and save time. Hwang chul soon mainly focuses on compound movements that work in multiple muscle groups. It’s no surprise, that in addition to the strict workout regimen, chul required a structured diet that allowed him to get all the nutrients and vitamins that he needed, in order to make massive gains.</p>

If, for example, you’re not able to make it to the gym on friday, you can just push that workout back to saturday. If you’re just getting started or planning to start weight lifting, this could be a good starting point. You have 60 minutes at the gym;</p>
<h3 id="you-want-to-do-both-cardio-and-weights">You Want To Do Both Cardio And Weights.</h3><p>If you, like me, hit the gym monday to friday, here is a great workout combination to really make the most of your time at the gym. This program requires you to workout 4 days per week. Here�s your three day weight training routine: Bench, 3 sets, 5 reps.</p>
<h3 id="your-objective-is-to-lean-out">Your Objective Is To Lean Out.</h3><p>You can start this program doing 5x5, but you will need to switch to 3x5 soon enough as 5x5 is going to become too much. The core muscles in the abdomen, pelvis and lower back connect the lower and upper body and help protect the back. Week 1, monday:workout a, wednesday: Each workout focuses on two to three specific muscle groups.</p>
<h3 id="you-should-also-perform-some-basic-stretches-and-warm-up-movements-as-well">You Should Also Perform Some Basic Stretches And Warm Up Movements As Well.</h3><p>Here’s an example of a training split you can use, but feel free to change the order or days of the workouts to your preference. Before you begin your working sets, you must first perform one or two warm up sets with a much lighter weight. This will help stretch out the muscles, get the blood flowing, and improve muscle elasticity to help prevent injuries. Let’s have a look at one of the sample menu plans of monday to friday diet plan.</p>
